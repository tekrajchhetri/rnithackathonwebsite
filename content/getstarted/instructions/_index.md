## Overview

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The hackathon tasks are based on computer network concepts discussed in lectures and the proseminar. During the hackathon, you will begin with a small network, and when the task is complete, you will have a large network that has solved numerous problems. Even if you are unable to complete all the tasks, you will still receive points if your configuration for smaller networks is correct. Therefore, the smaller networks that comprise the larger network can be considered subtasks. It is crucial that you work on a smaller network first and then move on to other configurations after a successful configuration, rather than configuring a large network all at once, as this increases the likelihood of misconfiguration and task failure.

As previously stated, you would implement the concepts learned in the computer network course. You would apply the following major concepts in particular:

- Design the network based on the given requirements
- Configuration of the network, such as IP address, subnet mask, and loopback address
- Configuration of switches and _Local Area Network (LAN)_, both physical and _Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)_
- Configuration of routers, autonomous systems (AS), and routing protocols such as _Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)_ and _Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)_

## Learning objectives

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This hackathon's primary educational objective is to provide hands-on, real-world experience with computer networking, such as the designing and configuration of networks and  troubleshooting, and to further strengthen students' problem solving and teamwork abilities.
